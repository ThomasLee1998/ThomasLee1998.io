<h1> Project Outline </h1>
<p>We are making a game that resembles pong. The goal of this game is to move a block back and forth along a linear path to block a ball from leaving the field of play. Think brick breaker except without bricks. We will have to give the ball hit detection and bounce abilities as well as keep the wall moving in a linear path. Every time the wall we control at the bottom blocks the ball your score will increase by one. The goal of the game is to last as long as possible with increasing speed as time goes on making the game harder and harder.

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p><b>Luke’s Reflection</b>

The hardest part of this project in my opinion was trying to get our idea to work with the formatting in android. We originally wanted the paddle to move in a circle but we couldn’t find a way to make that work so we had to abandon it. If we could improve anything it would be to just add more sprites that interact with the ball. I would also liked it if we could have gotten it to run smoother but I think our idea was pushing the limits of MIT app inventor as it was so we would have to use a different program.

<b>Tommy’s reflection.</b>

I found the hardest part of this project is to get the paddle moving in the opposite direction after pressing the button. Also the speed variable was very difficult to figure out. But I do feel we have accomplished our goal of the project it bounces and hits the paddle and we do have a score keeper so its decent

<b>Davis’ reflection.</b>
	The hardest part of this project was finding out how to move the sprites. Going from python to this was a bit different, in the aspect that app inventor already has blocks set out for you. Something that I could improve on would be to have better physics, because sometimes the ball will bounce off the side and go straight down. If we had extra time, that would be the first thing I would do. Also, the change directions button occasionally doesn’t work, which I think may be a problem with app inventor itself.
