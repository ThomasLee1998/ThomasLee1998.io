<h1> Project Outline </h1>
<p> Our group decided to make a calculator that will ask what the user wants to do, then take its inputs and comes out with a solution.  The calculator will be able to multiply, divide, add, subtract as well as other basic mathematical formulas.  These other formulas could include functions that use the Pythagorean Theorem or Newton’s Laws. We will also attempt to take in more than two inputs from the user instead of just two. The calculator will have multiple steps and ask very specifically what the user wants to do. The calculator will be very intuitive with no confusing steps.

<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p><b>Luke’s Reflection</b>

We wanted to created a simple calculator, and in that aspect I believe that our group met our goal. We were actually able to complete the four major functions fairly quickly, so the add on are what took the most time. We really wanted to make a calculator with a GUI that included all our equations, but we couldn’t find a way to do it without using someone elses code, and we didn’t even know how their code worked. If we were to do this project again then we would probably research calculator GUI’s more and incorporate that.

<b>Tommy’s reflection.</b>

In this project we have created a simple calculator but has some extra capability including  Pythagorean theorem, squarooting and adverging. So the only goal we didn't make was it being a button calculator instead of just text based because the button calculator currently is out of our knowledge . But other wise we met all are other goals that concludes an accurate calculator and have the all basic function and more.

<b>Davis’ reflection.</b>
	Our first goal was to make a calculator by using gui and drawpad. After further research, we decided that that would be a little too much for us. We decided to make a simple calculator, but with many added functions. I thought it was well structured in my mind, in the sense that it used functions effectively and has many uses. I thought the hardest part was adding a while loop to the adding and averaging functions, because I encountered many problems with changing variables. It was all worth it though, we ended up with an adding function that could theoretically take infinite inputs and add/average them together. The other functions were relatively easy, even the pythagorean theorem function.
